# Unreleased (fork)
- Segmented video recording: `VideoOptions.segmentDurationMs` splits one recording into
  consecutive complete files, reported by `CamerawesomePlugin.listenVideoSegments()`
  (Android: rolling persistent CameraX recordings; iOS: gap-free AVAssetWriter rollover)
- `CupertinoVideoOptions.bitrate`
- iOS honors `VideoOptions.enableAudio` (the mic was always added before)
- iOS: recording starts/stops on the sample queue; stop no longer hangs when no frame was written
- Android: stopping after a failed recording no longer crashes (`recordings!!`);
  a second stop request is answered instead of being dropped
- Segmented recordings survive image analysis start/stop (the bound `VideoCapture`
  is kept) and retry a segment the camera killed before it produced data
- `startRecording` stays in video mode when the platform refuses to record, and
  `stopRecording` always leaves the recording state
- pause / resume are not supported for segmented recordings
- Generated pigeon files are hand-edited (see `pigeons/pigeon.sh`)
